# Space-invaders

## Project overview

This project is a Space Invaders app built as I continue to learn Python using pygame. 

This was my first pygame project and I used (this great tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM] as a guide. 

## How to run the project 

Once you have cloned and opened the repo:
- Run the path of the python and the main.py file in the command line. On my system, this looks like this: /usr/local/bin/python3 /Users/dantyler/Coding-Projects/Python-Space-Invaders/main.py
- Alternatively, if using VS Code, use the built in python play button in the top right hand corner.
